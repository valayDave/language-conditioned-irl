## Disclaimer: 
1. This is a very old project made in 2021, while I was in grad school (before transformers were sexy and ChatGPT didn't exist) so running it and expecting it to work feels like wishful thinking. 
2. This project is a research project so even if a lot of it shouldn't work today, the ideas can still be useful.
